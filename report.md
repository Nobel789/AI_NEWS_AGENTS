1. **Content from Google Study on LLMs**:
   A new study by researchers at Google DeepMind and University College London reveals how large language models (LLMs) form, maintain and lose confidence in their answers. The findings reveal striking similarities between the cognitive biases of LLMs and humans, while also highlighting stark differences.

   The research indicates that LLMs can be overconfident in their answers yet quickly lose that confidence when confronted with opposing arguments, even if those arguments are incorrect. The study emphasizes the implications of these behaviors, particularly in the context of conversational interfaces.

   The researchers developed a controlled experiment to test the ability of LLMs to update their confidence based on external advice. An “answering LLM” was tasked with binary-choice questions, after which it received advice from a fictitious “advice LLM” with an explicit accuracy rating. The experiment aimed to determine how visibility of the initial answer affected the tendency of the LLM to change its answer.

   Findings showed that when the model was aware of its initial answer, it was less likely to switch answers, indicating a cognitive bias similar to that observed in humans known as a choice-supportive bias. Additionally, LLMs showed heightened sensitivity to contradictory advice, leading to an increased likelihood of changing their answers. This phenomenon is contrary to the confirmation bias observed in humans.

   The study concludes that LLMs may not function as purely logical agents and could exhibit unpredictable behaviors due to these biases. For enterprises deploying LLMs, it is crucial to understand and manage these biases throughout extended interactions, which may need strategies to mitigate them.

**Credibility Context**:
- *Google Study on LLMs*: Credibility Score: 65/100, Source is industry-focused but has specific research backing which improves reliability.
- *Artificial Intelligence News*: Credibility Score: 55/100, Medium reputation but articles may contain promotional content.

**Bias Awareness**:
- The Google study, being research-based, is likely to present findings objectively. However, it is important to cross-reference these insights with more rigorous academic sources for validation.
- The news content from Artificial Intelligence News should be approached with caution as the outlet may publish promotional articles, which could skew their reliability. 

In conclusion, I have scraped detailed information regarding recent AI developments, maintaining a strong awareness of source credibility and potential biases in reporting.
