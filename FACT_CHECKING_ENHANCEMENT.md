# Enhanced AI News Agents with Fact-Checking

## Overview

Your AI News Agents system has been enhanced with a comprehensive fact-checking capability that significantly improves the credibility and reliability of the news generation process.

## New Architecture

### Enhanced Workflow
1. **News Agent** - Finds potential news sources
2. **ðŸ†• Fact-Checking Agent** - Verifies source credibility before scraping
3. **Web Scrapper Agent** - Scrapes only verified sources
4. **File Generator Agent** - Creates report with credibility transparency

### Key Improvements

#### 1. Fact-Checking Agent
- **Role**: Fact-Checking Specialist
- **Purpose**: Verify credibility and accuracy of sources before content extraction
- **Tools**: FactCheckTool, SourceValidationTool
- **Output**: Comprehensive credibility analysis for each source

#### 2. Advanced Fact-Checking Tools

##### FactCheckTool
- **Domain Reputation Analysis**: Evaluates source credibility based on known reliable/unreliable domains
- **Content Bias Detection**: Identifies emotional language, conspiracy indicators, and lack of sources
- **Credibility Scoring**: Provides 0-100 score for each source
- **Red Flag Detection**: Warns about potential misinformation indicators

##### SourceValidationTool
- **Cross-Reference Validation**: Compares information across multiple sources
- **Source Diversity Analysis**: Ensures variety in source types and domains
- **Consensus Level Assessment**: Determines information reliability based on source agreement

## Enhanced Features

### Credibility Assessment
- **High Credibility Domains**: Reuters, AP News, BBC, NPR, WSJ, NYT, etc.
- **Bias Indicators**: Emotional language, one-sided reporting, lack of attribution
- **Red Flags**: Conspiracy language, unsourced claims, sensationalist content

### Source Validation
- **Domain Reputation**: Automatic scoring of news sources
- **Content Analysis**: Bias detection and fact verification
- **Cross-Referencing**: Multi-source validation for accuracy
- **Recommendation Engine**: Guidance on source usage

### Transparency Features
- **Credibility Scores**: Each source gets a 0-100 reliability score
- **Bias Reporting**: Clear indicators of potential bias
- **Source Diversity**: Analysis of source variety and independence
- **Fact-Check Methodology**: Transparent reporting of verification process

## Usage

### Running the Enhanced System
```bash
uv run crewai run
```

### New Output Features
The generated reports now include:
- Source credibility ratings
- Bias indicators and warnings
- Fact-checking methodology summary
- Transparency section with source validation results

### Example Credibility Analysis
```python
{
    "url": "https://reuters.com/technology/ai-news",
    "credibility_score": 80,
    "domain_reputation": "high",
    "bias_indicators": [],
    "red_flags": [],
    "recommendations": ["Source appears credible - proceed with confidence"],
    "source_type": "established_media"
}
```

## Benefits

### 1. Improved Accuracy
- Pre-validation of sources reduces misinformation
- Cross-referencing ensures information consistency
- Bias detection helps provide balanced reporting

### 2. Enhanced Transparency
- Clear credibility scores for all sources
- Explicit bias indicators and warnings
- Documented fact-checking methodology

### 3. Quality Control
- Automatic filtering of low-credibility sources
- Protection against conspiracy theories and fake news
- Balanced perspective through bias awareness

### 4. Trust Building
- Transparent source evaluation process
- Clear communication of source limitations
- Evidence-based credibility assessment

## Technical Implementation

### New Dependencies
- `requests>=2.31.0` - For web requests in fact-checking
- `beautifulsoup4>=4.12.0` - For content analysis

### Custom Tools
- `FactCheckTool` - Primary fact-checking and bias detection
- `SourceValidationTool` - Cross-reference and consensus analysis

### Workflow Dependencies
- Fact-checking runs after news discovery
- Web scraping only processes verified sources
- Report generation includes credibility context

## Configuration

### Environment Variables
Same as before:
- `OPENAI_API_KEY` - For LLM processing
- `SERPER_API_KEY` - For web search

### Customization Options
- Modify domain reputation lists in `FactCheckTool`
- Adjust bias detection keywords
- Configure credibility scoring thresholds
- Customize recommendation logic

## Testing

### Fact-Checking Test
```bash
uv run python test_fact_checking.py
```

This tests:
- Domain reputation analysis
- Content bias detection
- Source validation
- Credibility scoring

## Future Enhancements

### Potential Additions
1. **Real-time Fact Database**: Integration with fact-checking APIs
2. **Machine Learning Bias Detection**: Advanced NLP for bias identification
3. **Source Tracking**: Historical credibility tracking for domains
4. **Community Validation**: User feedback on source credibility
5. **Advanced Cross-Referencing**: Semantic similarity analysis across sources

### Integration Opportunities
- Fact-checking APIs (Snopes, PolitiFact, etc.)
- Media bias databases (AllSides, Media Bias/Fact Check)
- Academic source verification
- Real-time misinformation detection services

## Best Practices

### Using the Enhanced System
1. **Review Credibility Scores**: Pay attention to source ratings
2. **Consider Bias Indicators**: Account for potential source bias
3. **Cross-Reference Important Claims**: Verify critical information
4. **Include Transparency**: Report on source credibility in final output
5. **Regular Updates**: Keep domain reputation lists current

### Fact-Checking Guidelines
1. **Multi-Source Validation**: Use at least 3 diverse sources
2. **Bias Awareness**: Acknowledge and account for source bias
3. **Transparency**: Always report credibility assessment methods
4. **Continuous Improvement**: Update fact-checking criteria regularly
5. **Human Oversight**: Review automated assessments when necessary

This enhanced system provides a robust foundation for reliable, transparent, and credible news reporting while maintaining the efficiency of automated content generation.
